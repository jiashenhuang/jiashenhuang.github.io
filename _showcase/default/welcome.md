    <h2>Welcome to Showcase!</h2>

        Hello, and welcome to my showcase! Beyond my academic and professional life, I find joy in traveling, films, and music. I’ve been studying traditional Chinese ethnic singing for years — a gentle way of staying in touch with my heritage. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to explore wonderful places like the United States, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, each leaving me with unique memories and inspirations.

        My days are brightened by my dog’s company, spontaneous trips, and evenings spent with friends over whisky and good conversation.
