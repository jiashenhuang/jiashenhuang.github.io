    <h2>Welcome to Showcase!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <code>Showcase</code> is a page where you can show off almost anything you want. It can be the photo of your pets, your favorite books, your favorite projects, or anything else you want to show to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can create a new showcase item by creating a new file in the <code>_showcase</code> folder. It gives you the highest flexibility to customize the item using any HTML code.
